Vision
======

The Vision projects form an integrated collection of programs and libraries supporting mail,
news (NNTP), and calendaring functions. Unlike some other applications the Vision projects are
intended to expose the technical details of these systems and thus support "expert" users.

These projects also make use of several supporting facilities including

1. Cryptography
2. HTML rendering
3. Image processing
4. Various algorithms and data structures

The primary programming language of the Vision projects is Scala. The long term goal is to
depend minimally on third party libraries, particularly third party libraries in other
languages. Reliability is a high priority for the Vision projects following the idea that even
"ordinary" desktop applications deserve to be robust.
